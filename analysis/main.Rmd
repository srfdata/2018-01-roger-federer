## Preliminary Remarks

This document illustrates the analysis of the article [20 years, 20 titles on srf.ch](https://www.srf.ch/static/srf-data/data/2018/federer/#/en).

SRF Data attaches great importance to transparent and reproducible data preprocessing and -analysis. SRF Data believes in the principles of open data but also open and reproducible methods. Third parties should be empowered to build on the work of SRF Data and to generate new analyses and applications.

### R-Script & Processed Data

The analysis of the data was conducted in the [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). The RMarkdown script used to generate this document and all the resulting data can be downloaded under this [link](https://srfdata.github.io/`r project_name`/rscript.zip). Through executing `analysis.Rmd`, the herein described process can be reproduced and this document can be generated. In the course of this, data from the folder `ìnput` will be processed and results will be written into `output`.

**R version `r r_version`** is used. If the code does not work, it is very likely that an older R version is installed. If an error occures it sometimes helps to execute the script several times. Particularly in the case of package installation problems it could be helpful to restart the R session and execute the code over again. If necessary, third party libraries like `libgdal-dev` have to be installed.

### GitHub

The code for the herein described process can also be freely downloaded from [https://github.com/srfdata/`r project_name`](https://github.com/srfdata/`r project_name`). Criticism in the form of GitHub issues and pull requests are very welcome!

### Original source

The database was set up and initialised by Mileta Cekovic which runs [Ultimate Tennis Statistics](http://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/). This project's data is based on information found on the [ATP Website](https://atpworldtour.com/), which does not offer an official data API.

The point by point data used in chapter 9 was collected by [Jeff Sackmann](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/) and a team of volunteers. Their project is called the [Map Charting Project](www.tennisabstract.com/charting/). The data is not imported directly but via the [deuce package](https://github.com/skoval/deuce) by [Stephanie Kovalchik](http://on-the-t.com/) who offers a lot of Jeff Sackmann's data in a handy R package.

#### Last updated

- The MCP [github repo](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject) has not been updated for 4 months.
- Tour Finals 2017 are missing in the ultimatetennisstatistics data because it's missing on the [ATP Website](http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/scores/archive/nitto-atp-finals/605/2017/results).
- Besides that the data was last updated on the 17th of January (Australian Open 2018 is thus not included).
